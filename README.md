# SierpinskiRGB
This is a C++ and SFML solution for generating Sierpinski triangles.

## Using a different graphics library
Most of the code works independently of SFML, with the exception of SFTriangleWrapper.
SFTriangleWrapper takes one of the triangles generated by SierpinskiGenerator (represented using Triangle class),
and adds its vertices (x and y coordinates from the Point2d class) to an SFML vertex array object.
Hence, to make this work in other graphics libraries (i.e., OpenGL), you just need to create a wrapper class that works
in a similar fashion to SFTriangleWrapper, converting the Triangle vertices into something that works in your choice of graphics library.

Alternatively, it can also generate black and white Sierpinski triangles.
