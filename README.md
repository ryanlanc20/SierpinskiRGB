# SierpinskiRGB
This is a C++ and SFML solution for generating Sierpinski triangles.

## Compiling
The visual studio solution file has been uploaded, so you should be able to load this project on windows.
However, to make it work with SFML, you'll need to download SFML-2.5.1 from https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/.
The Visual C++ 15 (2017) - 64-bit version was used in this project.

### Instructions for downloading and linking SFML
* Unzip the downloaded library
* Navigate inside the unzipped folder and copy the SFML-2.5.1 folder.
* Navigate to SierpinskiRGB/SierpinskiRGB and paste the SFML-2.5.1 folder.
* Copy all .dll files from SFML-2.5.1 into SierpinskiRGB/SierpinskiRGB.
* Load up the visual studio solution (if you haven't already) and run the program

Note: Dynamic linking is currently used, which means that all the dll files must be available alongside the generated executable file.

## Using a different graphics library
Most of the code works independently of SFML, with the exception of SFTriangleWrapper.
SFTriangleWrapper takes one of the triangles generated by SierpinskiGenerator (represented using Triangle class),
and adds its vertices (x and y coordinates from the Point2d class) to an SFML vertex array object.
Hence, to make this work in other graphics libraries (i.e., OpenGL), you just need to create a wrapper class that works
in a similar fashion to SFTriangleWrapper, converting the Triangle vertices into something that works in your choice of graphics library.
